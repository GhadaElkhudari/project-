The shop was opened on 11/4/2011, with the opening of the shop and I think about what is possible to develop. 
The idea was from the beginning to invent something from nothing means such as : how to work the idea of a square
 if you saw any limit and you turn it into the idea of benefiting from it. At first I traveled until I learned  
 the engraving on the wood and carving wood cutters and taught them in the beginning manual and engraving wood
 engraving manual and what I felt in the turnout of people on new ideas I was thinking Shaw on his way to take 
 orders for the handwork was taking time . <br> <br>

I traveled to find out whether there was a manual work or a new idea in this area and I knew people were the same 
 thing. They dug a manual and invented a machine to dig wood by turning the electricity into a machine to burn wood.
 And returned and invented the same way to dig and thank God was a successful experiment. <br> <br> 

With time I traveled to China and bought a laser machine using a computer. It was a period of time. 
Everything Beetor did. Each idea was new. I entered the idea of a printer with wood and took design courses on 
 more than one program ,so I could print on the wood and worked at first. I learned from the mistakes that will
 happen, I traveled the popularity of the Chinese people and bought the UV PRINTER device, and We started with a new idea
 and with the days in this field everything is evolved with the evolution of ideas and technology.<br><br>

Accreditation should be on how to deal with the customer as the most important element of the material. <br> 

Of course, the plan, God willing, is to be the largest operator of the printing industry, wood engraving and the
 manufacture of boxes and export. <br> 
 We open a branch to be Bihnm gifts and way of packaging and the branch is located in it everything Btaglak 
 gifts and accessories and canteens and hand-made sure. <br><br>

It is products to offer : <br>
(Perfumes, gifts, accessories, graduation books, manual works,  engraving and cutting on wood, 
printing pagets, thermal printing) . <br> <br> <br>
